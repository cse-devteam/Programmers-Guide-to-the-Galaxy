# Raspberry Pi's
#### A Debian baked good.

### What is a Raspberry Pi?
You may have seen a couple of these if you were ever in Boffin Factory. They are cheap credit card sized computers that all the hobists are talking about. They run a specialized version of Debian called Raspbian, though some of the newer and more powerful models can run other linux versions.

While they are tiny, they sure are mighty. You wont make any money off them bit coin mining, but they are powerful enough to host minecraft servers, discord bots, and even be the backbone of a home security system.

There are multiplie different models of a Raspberry Pi. Some are more or less powerful. The least powerful being the Zero W and Pico, and the most probably being the Pi 4. Just like an AWS instance, look into what you need spec wise. This is especially important for RAM and Voltage considerations.

### So what comes on an average Pi?
We will look at 2 examples, the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and the Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (Roughly $30)
* 1 GB RAM
* Wireless LAN and BLE on board
* Ethernet
* 4 USB 2 Ports
* 40 Pin extended GPIO
* Full Sized HDMI
* Micro SD Port
* DSI Display Port
* CSI Camera Port
* Audio Jack

Raspberry Pi Zero W (Roughly $5)
* Wireless LAN on board
* Bluetooth 4.1
* 512 MB RAM
* Micro USB power
* 40 Pin Extended GPIO
* Mini HDMI
* Mini USB
* CSI Camera Port

### So what can I do with it?
Well, its basically a full blown computer and runs Linux. There are a ton of projects for gadgets to make with them, or you could just use it as a remote Linux server in a drawer.

If you don't know how cool GPIO Pins are, you should read the GPIO guide!
